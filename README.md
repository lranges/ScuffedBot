# ScuffedBot
ScuffedBot replies to your question and provides information about our beloved university, SFU, in its own unique ways.

Using Python and its libraries, we created a machine-learning model, ScuffedBot. We use Neural Networks (specifically through TensorFlow's Keras) to train our model to give output depending on our user's questions.
